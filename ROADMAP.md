# Roadmap — pluggable framework core

Durable record of work **deferred** from the foundation slice. The foundation
slice (commits on `feat/pluggable-framework-core`) establishes the pattern:
core abstractions in `codesmith-agent`, a registry wired into `build_engine`,
and a `codesmith-providers` crate with one sample (`mock`) provider behind
Cargo features. Everything below extends that slice.

Each item carries enough detail (file references, coupling notes) to be picked
up directly. See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the layering.

## §A — Provider extraction (bulk migration)

Move the production LLM clients out of the `codesmith-tui` binary into
`codesmith-providers`, behind Cargo features. The coupling map below was
gathered from `crates/tui/src/client/` (binary-only crate; the client module
is carved out of `main.rs`).

### A1 — Extract the OpenAI-compatible client
- Move `crates/tui/src/client.rs` (`DeepSeekClient`, ~1190 lines) +
  `crates/tui/src/client/chat.rs` (~2380 lines) into
  `crates/providers/src/openai_compat/`.
- `DeepSeekClient::new(config: &Config)` cannot move with the struct (orphan
  rule: a tui-local inherent `impl` can't live on a `codesmith-providers`
  type). The 12 call sites (`ui.rs`, `main.rs`, `mcp_server.rs`,
  `acp_server.rs`, `commands/config.rs`, `core/engine/tests.rs`,
  `tools/subagent/tests.rs`) switch to `resolve_llm_client(&config)` or
  `from_parts(...)`. `from_parts` already exists (Step 2).
- Re-export the moved type from tui (`pub use codesmith_providers::...`) only
  if a shim is needed; prefer routing through the registry.

### A2 — Extract the Anthropic client
- Move `crates/tui/src/client/anthropic.rs` (`AnthropicClient`, ~940 lines)
  into `crates/providers/src/anthropic/` behind the `anthropic` feature.
- Same orphan-rule constraint on its `new(config: &Config)`.

### A3 — Lift the shared client helpers
- These are used by **both** clients today (defined in `client.rs`, imported
  via `use super::{...}` by `anthropic.rs`): `ERROR_BODY_MAX_BYTES`,
  `SSE_BACKPRESSURE_*` consts, `acquire_stream_buffer`/`release_stream_buffer`
  (backed by a `OnceLock<Mutex<Vec<Vec<u8>>>>` buffer pool),
  `add_extra_root_certs`, `bounded_error_text`, `force_http1_from_env`,
  `validate_base_url_security`.
- Move them into `crates/providers/src/common/` so both extracted clients
  share one copy.

### A4 — De-duplicate the per-client helpers
- `TokenBucket`, `build_default_headers`, `build_http_client`,
  `retry_reason_label` are duplicated across `client.rs` and `anthropic.rs`.
  Unify where the semantics match; keep separate where they differ
  (Anthropic auth headers, `anthropic_messages_url`).

---

## §B — Decoupling substitutions

These are the seams that keep `codesmith-providers` free of TUI/host coupling.
They are blockers for A1/A2 being "clean" (the code can move first with the
deps still wired, then these substitutions remove the wires).

### B1 — Logging facade (blocks clean A1)
- `crate::logging` (`crates/tui/src/logging.rs`) is a **binary-local module**,
  not a crate: verbose-gated `eprintln!` with `crate::palette` colors. Client
  code calls only `logging::info` / `logging::warn`.
- Not a trivial `tracing` swap (changes output destination + drops palette
- coupling). Options: (a) add a `codesmith_agent::log` facade (info/warn via a
  settable sink; tui's `logging.rs` installs the sink at startup — preserves
  behavior); (b) swap to `tracing` and accept the behavior change.
- Recommended: (a). Land the facade in `codesmith-agent`, point the extracted
  clients at it.

### B2 — `retry_status` → outcome callback (blocks clean A1/A2)
- `crate::retry_status` (`codesmith-agent-runtime/src/retry_status.rs`) is a
  process-wide `OnceLock<Mutex<RetryState>>` singleton. The clients call
  `start` / `succeeded` / `failed` / `clear` in `send_with_retry`
  (`client.rs:719`, `anthropic.rs:193`).
- The per-attempt `on_retry` hook already exists (`ProviderConfig.on_retry`,
  wired through `with_retry`'s `RetryCallback` at `client.rs:747`). What's
  still global-only are the **terminal** calls (`succeeded`/`failed`/`clear`)
  on the `RetryResult` outcome — they can't ride the per-attempt callback.
- Extend `ProviderConfig` with an outcome callback (or a `RetryHooks` struct)
  so the extracted clients stop touching the global singleton; the host (tui)
  injects a hook that drives the footer banner.

### B3 — `ApiProvider` → `ProviderKind`
- `ApiProvider` (`codesmith-agent-runtime/src/config_types.rs:200`, 17
  variants) diverges from `ProviderKind` (`codesmith-config/src/lib.rs:73`, 16
  variants): `ApiProvider::DeepseekCN` has no `ProviderKind` peer (the
  `deepseek-cn` aliases collapse onto `Deepseek`).
- The OpenAI-compat client branches on `ApiProvider` in only two places
  (`chat.rs:80` `apply_provider_token_limit` — XiaomiMimo; `chat.rs:1915`
  `provider_accepts_reasoning_content` — 9-variant allowlist). Everywhere else
  it's stored/forwarded (`provider_name` returns `api_provider.as_str()`).
- Resolve the `DeepseekCN` alias (fold into `Deepseek`, or add it to
  `ProviderKind`), then switch the client + factory to `ProviderKind` so
  `codesmith-providers` doesn't depend on `codesmith-agent-runtime`'s
  `config_types`.

### B4 — `prompt_runtime` location
- `crate::prompt_runtime` is `pub use codesmith_agent_runtime::prompt_runtime::*`
  (canonical home: `crates/agent-runtime/src/prompt_runtime.rs`). Only
  `chat.rs` uses it: `parse_rendered_sections`, `system_prompt_to_text`,
  `PromptCachePolicy`, `PromptSectionStability` — shallow (4 items, pure
  functions + small enums) but load-bearing for prompt-cache keying.
- Either (a) move `prompt_runtime` into `codesmith-agent` core (cleaner
  layering — providers depend only on core), or (b) accept the
  `codesmith-providers → codesmith-agent-runtime` dep. Recommended: (a) once
  B1/B2 also land, so providers depend solely on `codesmith-agent`.

## §C — Cargo feature expansion

### C1 — `openai-compat` feature
- Gate the A1 extraction behind `openai-compat` in `crates/providers/Cargo.toml`.
- Add `reqwest`, `sha2`, `tokio` (streaming), `serde_json` deps under the
  feature.

### C2 — `anthropic` feature
- Gate the A2 extraction behind `anthropic`.

### C3 — Per-provider sub-features
- Consider splitting the OpenAI-compatible family (deepseek, nvidia-nim,
  openrouter, …) into sub-features or a single `openai-compat` feature with
  runtime config — decide based on binary-size / compile-time goals.

### C4 — Lego recipe in CI
- Add a CI job: `cargo +1.90.0 build -p codesmith-providers --no-default-features`
  (provider-less build) and `--features mock` / `--features openai-compat`
  (à la carte). Today only `mock` exists; extend as C1/C2 land.

### C5 — Feature-gated `default_registry` growth
- `crates/providers/src/lib.rs::default_registry` already shadows-registers
  each enabled provider. As features land, add their shadow blocks (or a
  single `any(...)`-gated block).

### C6 — Workspace dep audit
- Once providers no longer need `codesmith-agent-runtime` (post-B4), drop that
  dep edge to enforce the layering in the build graph.

---

## §D — Host integration

### D1 — TUI registers `codesmith-providers` factories
- `resolve_llm_client` (`crates/tui/src/core/engine.rs`) currently builds a
  fresh registry with only the tui-local `DeepSeekProviderFactory`. Extend it
  to seed from `codesmith_providers::default_registry()` (under a tui feature
  gate) so compiled-in providers are available, then register the
  tui-local `DeepSeekProviderFactory` on top (it captures `ApiProvider`, so it
  can't live in `codesmith-providers` until B3).

### D2 — Config escape hatch for custom providers
- `ApiProvider` has no `Mock`/custom variant, so `provider = "mock"` can't be
  selected via config today. Add a config path for custom provider ids (e.g. a
  `provider = "custom:<id>"` form, or a `[[providers.custom]]` table) that
  maps to `ProviderId::Custom`, so a user can select any registered provider —
  the pi-mono "freely replace" UX.

---

## §E — Framework core growth (LangChain parity)

The provider seam is the first LangChain analog. These extend the core toward
a fuller agent framework.

### E1 — Agent executor loop
- A LangChain `AgentExecutor` analog: a loop that drives
  `LlmClient::create_message_stream` → tool calls → feed results back, with
  step/max-iteration caps. Today this lives tangled in `codesmith-agent-runtime`
  `Engine`; extract a reusable `AgentExecutor` trait + default impl in
  `codesmith-agent`.

### E2 — Tool / message abstractions in core
- Promote the tool-call protocol (`Tool`, `ToolUse`, `ToolResult` shapes in
  `models.rs`) into a `codesmith_agent::tools` module with a `Tool` trait
  (name, schema, async run), so providers and hosts share one tool contract.

### E3 — Memory / callback abstractions
- LangChain `Memory` + `Callbacks` analogs: a `ChatHistory` trait and a
  `Callback` trait (on_llm_start / on_llm_end / on_tool_*) in core, so the
  executor is observable and stateful without host coupling.

### E4 — Declarative config + lazy loading
- pi-mono loads `models.json` and lazily constructs providers. Add a
  declarative `providers.toml` (id, factory feature, base_url, model) consumed
  by `default_registry`, with lazy construction so an unused provider never
  pays a build cost.
