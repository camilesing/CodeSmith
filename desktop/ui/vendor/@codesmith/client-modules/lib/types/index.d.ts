/**
 * Node half of the client module system (`cds.client` dual-face package): scans
 * the host Loader's entries for packages declaring `cds.client`, composes the
 * `window.__CODESMITH_BOOT__` entry graph (wire single source: {@link WebBootEntry}
 * in `./client/manifest.ts`) in module-graph order, serves one-or-more-plugin
 * combo scripts plus their source maps, package-local chunks, and the
 * content-revisioned `./assets/*` exports of active client packages,
 * contributes the registration facade, application preloads, bootstrap scripts,
 * and graph to the webserver's index injection table, and provides the
 * `clientModules` service (the HMR node half's registration/notification
 * face).
 *
 * Package reconciliation is incremental by Loader entry name.
 * Every cordis `internal/plugin` emission (fiber construction/disposal) marks
 * the fiber's entry name dirty; a microtask flush reconciles each dirty name
 * against the Loader entries indexed at the start of that flush. Synchronous
 * package resolution must not add or remove Loader entries during reconciliation.
 * The activation pass seeds the same pending names and flushes synchronously,
 * so initial activation and steady state share one implementation. Each
 * reconciliation reads the package manifest and the bundle metadata again,
 * so an entry that restarts after its package was reinstalled or moved
 * publishes them as they are now; an unchanged result publishes nothing and
 * does not read the bundle. The manifest package name identifies the browser
 * module; distinct active Loader sources for that package are a composition
 * error. Bundle rebuilds outside
 * an entry restart reach the graph through {@link ClientModuleRegistry.rebuilt}.
