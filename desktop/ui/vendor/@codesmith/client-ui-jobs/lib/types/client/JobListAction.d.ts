 * or a settled one with retained output) starts its observation stream, and
 * collapsing (or closing the popover) stops it — output only flows while
 * someone is watching. A running row carries a two-press stop button that
 * requests a human kill through the job controller. Non-touch hover on a
 * text-visible trigger opens after 150ms and closes after 120ms outside both
 * trigger and portal. Compact triggers toggle on click; ArrowDown opens and
 * pins either layout. Interacting inside also pins the menu until explicit
 * dismissal; timers and the pin are local to the mounted session.
 * @param props - runtime slot currency, the jobs snapshot hook, the roster,
 *   observation, and kill controls, and the namespace translator.
 * @returns the trigger and its popover list, or null when there is nothing to show.
