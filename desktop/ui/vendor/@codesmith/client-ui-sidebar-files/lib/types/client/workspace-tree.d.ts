 * The workspace navigator's input to the `sidebar.files.tree` Factory: a pane's

 * joins the parent with `/` after dropping its trailing separators, so every
 * key below the root is already a tree key. Only the root differs: its tree
 * key drops its trailing separators too, so `/` becomes the empty key and a
 * Windows drive root `C:\` becomes `C:`, and a top-level child's key still
 * ends at its parent's last `/`.
