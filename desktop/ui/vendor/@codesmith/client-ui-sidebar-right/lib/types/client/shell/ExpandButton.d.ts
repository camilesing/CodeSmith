/**
 * The way into a hidden panel: one button in the conversation header's corner
 * seat, visible only while the panel is collapsed.
 *
 * It lives in the conversation's own header rather than in the frame's right
 * column so that a collapsed Sidebar costs the conversation nothing — no rail,
 * no width, and the transcript's scrollbar stays at the column's edge. The
 * corner seat is its own, past the utilities' edge, so the button never joins
 * the utilities row. On mobile devices, the disabled button stays mounted
 * and hidden while the panel is shown, preserving the title's width during
 * the overlay slide. Desktop devices collapse the seat while the panel is shown.
 * It shares the panel's per-session store because both seats are session-scoped.
 *
 * The glyph is the left sidebar's collapse icon mirrored: the same affordance,
 * on the other edge.
